# High Priority

* Optimize Grid Rendering

Since updating only a part of the display is problematic in Android all screen must be redrawn in every update. Due to this, rendering is the most power-hungry part of the application.

* Implement Pinch Gestures for Zooming In/Out

# Medium Priority
* Add Hideable Screen Direction Keys

* Accept Upper Case Letters in Text Input

# Low Priority
* Allow Remapping Keys

* Stretch or Align Center the Grid

The Grid starts from top left corner and does not align or stretch when there is blank space between right and bottom edge of the screen.
